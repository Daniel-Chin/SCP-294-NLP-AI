# Predicting the result of consuming liquid from SCP 294 using GPT-2
## SCP 294
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-294  
A coffee machine that dispenses arbitrary liquid.  

## This Project
I use GPT-2 to predict the next word given "I drank {liquid}, so I".  
If the probability that the next word is "died" is higher than the threshold, you die.  
This can be used in the SCP containment breach game.
